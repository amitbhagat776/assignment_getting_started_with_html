A [tag] is a snippet of code enclosed within angle brackets ("<" and ">") that specifies an HTML element.
Tags are used to mark the beginning and end of elements, and they provide instructions to the web browser about how to render content.
example:
 <p> <h1>


An "element" is a complete structure in HTML that consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. It represents a specific piece of content or a structural component on a web page.
example:
<h2>This is an heading </h2>
